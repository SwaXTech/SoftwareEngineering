# Shortchanged
upstream activities

Description: Projects sometimes cut out non-coding activities such as requirements, architecture, and design. Also known as “jumping into coding,” the results of this mistake are predictable. Projects that skimp on upstream activities typically have to do the same work downstream at anywhere from 10 to 100 times the cost of doing it earlier.
Resumen: Recortar en tareas que no son código, como diseño, arquitectura o requerimientos. Si no analizas te trae problemas.
