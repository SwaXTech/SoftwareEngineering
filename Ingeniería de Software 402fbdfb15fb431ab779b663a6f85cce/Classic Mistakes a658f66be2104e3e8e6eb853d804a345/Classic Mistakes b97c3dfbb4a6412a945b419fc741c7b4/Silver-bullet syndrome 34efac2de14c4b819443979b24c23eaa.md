syndrome

Description: On some projects, there is an over reliance on the advertised benefits of previously unused technologies, tools, or 3rd party applications and too little information about how well they would do in the current development environment. When project teams latch onto a single new methodology or new technology and expect it to solve their cost, schedule, or quality problems, they are inevitably disappointed.
Resumen: Implementar nuevas tecnologías o metodologías pensando que en corto tiempo va a funcionar y arreglar todo.
