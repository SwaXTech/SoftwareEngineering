# Uncontrolled problem employees

Description: Failure to deal with problem personnel (e.g., a prima donna programmer) can threaten development effectiveness. This is a common problem and has been well-understood at least since Gerald Weinberg published Psychology of Computer Programming in 1971. Failure to take action to deal with a problem employee is the most common complaint that team members have about their leaders.
Resumen: No se combate el personal problem√°tico.
