# Politics placed over substance

Description: Larry Constantine reported on four teams that had four different kinds of political orientations. “Politicians” specialized in “managing up”— concentrating on relationships with their managers. “Researchers” concentrated on scouting out and gathering information. “Isolationists” kept to themselves, creating project boundaries that they kept closed to non team members. “Generalists” did a little bit of everything: they tended their relationships with their managers, performed research and scouting activities, and coordinated with other teams through the course of their normal workflow. Constantine reported that initially the political and generalist teams were both well regarded by top management. But after a year and a half, the political team was ranked dead last. Putting politics over results is fatal to software development effectiveness.
Resumen: Usan políticas distintas pero nunca se establece un estándar. Se debe focalizar en resultados y no en políticas.
