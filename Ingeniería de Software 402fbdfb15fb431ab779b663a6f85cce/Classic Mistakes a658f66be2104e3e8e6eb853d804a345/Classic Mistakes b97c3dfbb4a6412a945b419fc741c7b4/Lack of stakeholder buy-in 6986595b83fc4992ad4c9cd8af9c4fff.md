# Lack of stakeholder
buy-in

Description: All of the major players in a software-development effort must buy into the project. That includes the executive sponsor, team leader, team members, marketing, end-users, customers, and anyone else who has a stake in it. The close cooperation that occurs only when you have complete buy-in from all stakeholders allows for precise coordination of a software development effort that is impossible to attain without good buy-in.
Resumen: PM, team, marketing, usuarios, clientes. No hay coordinación ni conformidad de todos o la mayoría.
