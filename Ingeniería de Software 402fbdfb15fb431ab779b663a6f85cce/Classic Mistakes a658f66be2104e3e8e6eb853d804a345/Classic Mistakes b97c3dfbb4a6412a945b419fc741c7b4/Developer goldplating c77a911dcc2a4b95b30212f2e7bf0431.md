# Developer goldplating

Description: Developers are fascinated by new technology and are sometimes anxious to try out new capabilities of their language or environment or to create their own implementation of a slick feature they saw in another product—whether or not it’s required in their product. The effort required to design, implement, test, document, and support features that are not required adds cost and lengthens the schedule.
Resumen: Hacer funcionalidades que no son tan requeridas por el solo hecho de probar tecnología o cosas de la tecnología que se está usando.
