# Lack of automated
source-code control

Description: Failure to use automated source-code control exposes projects to needless risks. Without it, if two developers are working on the same part of the program, they have to coordinate their work manually and risk accidentally overwriting someone else’s work. People develop new code to out-of-date interfaces and then have to redesign their code when they discover that they were using the wrong version of the interface. Users report defects that you can’t reproduce because you have no way to recreate the build they were using.
Resumen: no usar sistemas como GIT de control de versiones entonces se pueden sobreescribir o pisar cosas del mismo archivo sin control.
