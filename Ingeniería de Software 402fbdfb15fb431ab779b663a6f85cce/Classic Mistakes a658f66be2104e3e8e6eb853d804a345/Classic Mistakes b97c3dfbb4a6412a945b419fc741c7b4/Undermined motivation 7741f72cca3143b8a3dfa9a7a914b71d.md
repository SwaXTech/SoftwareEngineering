# Undermined motivation

Description: Study after study has shown that motivation probably has a larger effect on productivity and quality than any other factor. On some projects, management can undermine morale throughout the project. Examples include giving a hokey pep talk, going on a long vacation while the team works through the holidays, and providing bonuses that work out to less than a dollar per overtime hour at the end.
Resumen: La motivaci√≥n juega un papel importante en la productividad, calidad y otros factores.
