# Switching development tools in the middle of a project

Description: This is an old standby that hardly ever works. Sometimes it can make sense to upgrade incrementally within the same product line, from version 3 to version 3.1 or sometimes even to version 4. But the learning curve, rework, and inevitable mistakes made with a totally new tool usually cancel out any benefit when you’re in the middle of a project.
Resumen: Cambiar las herramientas de trabajo o las tecnologías a la mitad de un proyecto.
