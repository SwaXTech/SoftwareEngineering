# Abandonment of planning under pressure

Description: Projects make plans and then routinely abandon them when they run into schedule trouble. This would not be a problem if the plans were updated to account for the schedule difficulties. The problem arises when the plans are abandoned with no substitute, which tends to make the project slide into code-and-fix mode.
Resumen: Abandonar la planificación cuando hay dificultades o presión por terminar.
