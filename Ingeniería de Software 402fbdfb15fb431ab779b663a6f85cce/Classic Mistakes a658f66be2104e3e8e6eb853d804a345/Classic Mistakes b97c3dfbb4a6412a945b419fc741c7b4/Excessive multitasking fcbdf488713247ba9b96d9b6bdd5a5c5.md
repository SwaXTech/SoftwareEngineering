# Excessive multitasking

Description: When software developers are assigned to more than one project, they must ‘task switch’ as they change their focus from one project to another. They must get out of ‘flow’ on one project and into ‘flow’ on another. Task switching can be a significant factor—some studies have said that each task switch in software development can incur a 5-30 minute downtime as a developer works out of flow on one project and works into flow on the other.
Resumen: Cambiar o tener más de un proyecto trae problemas de productividad y cuesta seguir el hilo rápido.
