# Wishful thinking

Description: Wishful thinking isn’t just optimism. It’s closing your eyes and hoping something works when you have no reasonable basis for thinking it will. Wishful thinking at the beginning of a project leads to big blowups at the end of a project. It undermines meaningful planning and can be at the root of other problems.”
Resumen: No optimismo sino pensar/esperar que funcione aunque no hiciste correctamente las cosas.
