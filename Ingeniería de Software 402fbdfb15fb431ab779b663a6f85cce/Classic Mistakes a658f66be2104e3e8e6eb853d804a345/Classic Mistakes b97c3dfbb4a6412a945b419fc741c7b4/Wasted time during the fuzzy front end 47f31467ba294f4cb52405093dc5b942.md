# Wasted time during the fuzzy front end

Description: The “fuzzy front end” is the time before the project starts, the time normally spent in the approval and budgeting process. It’s not uncommon for a project to spend months or years in the fuzzy front end and then to come out of the gates with an aggressive schedule.
Resumen: Perder tiempo en el comienzo donde se esperan aprobaciones o definiciones de procesos.
