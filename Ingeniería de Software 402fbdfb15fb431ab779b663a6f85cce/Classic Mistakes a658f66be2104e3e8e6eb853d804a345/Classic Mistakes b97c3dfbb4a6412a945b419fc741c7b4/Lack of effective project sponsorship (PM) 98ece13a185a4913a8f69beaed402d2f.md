# Lack of effective
project sponsorship (PM)

Description: High-level project sponsorship is necessary to support many aspects of effective development including realistic estimates, adequate resource allocation, and achievable schedules, as well as helping to clear roadblocks once the project is underway. Without an effective project sponsor, other high-level personnel in your organization can force you to accept unrealistic deadlines or make changes that undermine your project.
Resumen: Sin un sponsor bien se pueden aceptar estimaciones o tiempos l√≠mites poco realistas, o aceptar cambios que traen problemas en el proyecto.
