# Research-oriented development

Description: Some projects have goals that push the state of the art—algorithms, speed, memory usage, and so on. That’s fine, but when those projects also have ambitious cost or schedule goals, the combination of advancing the state of the art with a tight budget on a short schedule isn’t achievable.
Resumen: Querer mejorar la performance al máximo, velocidad, buenos algoritmos, uso de memoria óptimo pero con poco tiempo (good enough)
