# Code-like-hell programming

Description: Some organizations think that fast, loose, all-as-you-go coding is a route to rapid development. If the developers are sufficiently motivated, they reason, they can overcome any obstacles. This is far from the truth. The entrepreneurial model is often a cover for the old code and-fix paradigm combined with an ambitious schedule, and that combination almost never works.
Resumen: Codear tan rápido como puedas comiéndote muchos bugs o pasando cosas.
